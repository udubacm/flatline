                <p>ACM officership is a great way to be involved in your CSE
                 community. Not only does it provide great visibility within the
                  department and many opportunities for building relationships,
                  it also gives you a lot of time with industry recruiters and
                 engineers.</p>
                <p>Voting will be staggered; we will determine positions in 
                this order: Chair, Vice Chair, Treasurer, Secretary, External

                    As the current Vice Chair of ACM, I have helped our humble
                     chapter kick back into gear with increased events, more 
                    student-led opportunities, and the return of the student store!
                     When I am not busy with schoolwork, teaching, or research, I
                     spend my time managing SnackOverflow and cleaning out the
                     student fridges. With a year of experience as an ACM officer
                    already under my belt, I promise you (yes, you!) an amazing
                     future year as an undergraduate in our fair CSE department.

                    I'm super passionate about CS and want to take it forward
                    by encouraging more students to pursue it, and to use their
                     skills outside of the classes as well. Ultimately, there 
                    should also be some inter-departmental cooperation and events 
                    (if that's within the rules) so that students can explore more. 
                    This would mean more and better events for everyone in the
                     department, and a prospect of stronger relationship with the
                     rest of the school.

                    <p>
                    Hi I'm Clint Malcolm. I want to continue to help improve UW 
                    CSE. I want to foster relations in industry to help out the 
                    labs and the lounge, have more events to connect us and teach 
                    us, and to continue to help us all have the best possible
                     experience in CSE. Despite what you may assume, I am not a
                    spam bot even if I sent out a lot of emails. I have served as 
                    the ACM Internal Relations officer this year, and believe that 
                    I have grown to learn what CSE needs ACM to do and that I 
                    can effectively have it reach it's goals. Through helping
                     efficiently run events, assisting with the launch of Snack
                     Overflow, and starting new events I have gained invaluable
                     experience to help UW CSE. My experience in Industry at 
                    Facebook and my other leadership experience in Band, as a TA, 
                    and in other student organization has enabled me to 
                    effectively manage any position.

                    Like most of us, I have benefited greatly from my time at UW. 
                    In addition to a world class education, I have made industry
                     contacts giving me the opportunity to experience internships 
                    at Intel and Twitter. I am surrounded by researchers at the 
                    top of their fields and have interacted with some of the 
                    coolest and geekiest individuals I have ever had the pleasure 
                    of meeting. For some of you, we've share classes and labs, 
                    others I'm TAing for right now (451 I promise I'll have the
                     grading done soon!!). While I also sit on the Provost Advisory
                     Committee and the Student Technology Fee Committee, a position
                     as your ACM officer will allow me to more directly give back,
                     continue the legacy of our outgoing officers, and help the
                    department grow through the coming year. There is much work to 
                    be done, Hackathons, Snack Overflow, Dev Nights, maintaining 
                    our relationships in industry and building new ones, working 
                    with administration to share the burden of governance, but we 
                    are used to putting in the long hours. It was requested that 
                    I end this with a haiku (I apologize in advanced): 
                    </p>

                    I am a freshman direct admit to computer science and would 
                    love to become an ACM officer during my second year here at 
                    the UW. I love the CS community here and I think it's really
                     important that we all stay connected through various events
                     on and off campus. I feel that ACM helps turn all the 
                    students, faculty, and staff into one big family through 
                    various exciting events and services (i.e. SnackOverflow), and 
                    I would love to be a part of the community that makes it 
                    all happen :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I really enjoy reaching out to people, making new friends, 
                    and listening to other people's needs, and feel that ACM would 
                    be a great opportunity to act as a liaison between the CSE
                     department and it's students.

                    Being in UW CSE for the past year has taught me many important
                     things. It has taught me how to sort data in O (N log N) time.
                     It has taught me how to whiteboard code and find the best 
                    T-shirts at career fairs. It has taught me to appreciate the
                     perks of 002, from its random outburst of card gamesto its
                     extraordinarily comfortable chairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But most importantly, it has taught me the value of the UW 
                    CSE community. ACM manages to make a program with hundreds 
                    of students feel tight-knit and familial. It gives new majors 
                    the chance to connect with experienced upperclassmen and 
                    learn the ins and outs of CSE. As a new major last fall, I
                     greatly appreciated the events that ACM put on, such as the 
                    ACM-ICPC, career fair prep sessions, and Fallfest.  I would 
                    be really excited to help organize events such as these next 
                    year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I would also like to help ACM start some new events next year.
                     For example, I would like to start a weekly interview
                     preparation series, where students meet to exchange tips,
                     practice whiteboard coding in groups, and critique each 
                    other’s performances. This would help students not only 
                    develop coding skills, but also presentation skills. Also, it
                     would be great to see ACM organize a multi-disciplinary 
                    mingling event between CSE, Informatics, the Business school, 
                    and other departments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    UW CSE has become a home away from home for me, and I would
                     really to share this great experience with everyone.

                     building a community of builders/hackers/creators that 
                    teaching each other everything around building websites and 
                    apps. I'm super active in the hackathon community, have lots 
                    of internship experience (from LinkedIn, Tableau Software, 
                    and Nor1), and have demonstrated leadership through co-founding
                     Sudo Soldiers. I hope to become more deeply involved in 
                    leading future ACM events and further strengthen the bond in 
                    the CSE community. Let's build and learn together!
